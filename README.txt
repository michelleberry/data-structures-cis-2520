Assignment 7 of CIS*2520 Data Structures!

*I did not write ttt1.c, ttt.h or alphatoe.c as they were provided by the instructor. the rest of the code I wrote*

This program uses acyclic directed graph to predict the next best tic tac toe move. In doing this I have created
a tic tac toe AI which is unbeatable. This was definitely the best assignment of the course and it makes me want to 
take the AI course at Guelph which is also taught by same instructor (Stefan Kremer).

Files count_nodes and show_node are used to see the graph in more detail. You can view specific nodes in the graph 
as well as how many nodes are in the graph currently. 

Compile with "make all" and run ./alphatoe to play the unbeatable tic tac toe game.
